⚙️ Environment Setup

Before running the project locally, you’ll need to configure your environment variables.

Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the project.

Inside .env.local, add the following key:

VITE_API_TMDB_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here


To get your own TMDB API key:

Go to TMDB Developer Authentication
.

Create an account (if you don’t have one already).

Copy that key and replace your_tmdb_api_key_here in the .env.local file.
